                    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
                    <p>In this project overview/tutorial, I'll be explaining how I was able to go through the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to effectively pull data from Basketball-Reference. The motivation for this project is that I wanted something to teach me web scraping basics. I also am a huge basketball fan and want to see what kind of funny insights I can draw from compiling all this data. I plan to make another entry to this series to cover some of the insights I find and show off some data visualization. Once that's done I'll link it here.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3><strong>Prerequisites</strong></h3>
                    <p>If you want to follow along you'll need the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Python 3</li>
                        <li> Pandas</li>
                        <li> BeautifulSoup</li>
                        <li> Basic Permissions to save .csv files</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3><strong>Goal</strong></h3>
                    <p>The goal of this overview is to show how to use BeautifulSoup to scrape data from Basketball-Reference. I'll be showing how to get player data, game data, and team data. I'll also show how to save the data to a .csv file for later use.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3><strong>Getting Started with Basketball-Reference</strong></h3>
                    <p>In order to get any information using BeautifulSoup, we first need to understand how the directories work on Basketball-Reference. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On basketball refrence there are 4 main pieces of data needed to find most pages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Year: </strong>The year is represented by a 4 digit integer (ex. 2022)</li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Player ID: </strong>The player ID is the first 5 letters of the player's last name, the first 2 letters of their first name and then a 2 digit number if there are any duplicates (ex. Jayson Tatum's Player ID is tatumja01).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li> <strong>Team ID: </strong>Team IDs are the 3 letter abbreviation of the team (ex. BOS for the Celtics). I've provided a map of the team abbreviations below</li>
                        <br>
                        <pre class="language-python">
                        <code class="language-python">

                    <br>
                    <li> <strong>Game ID: </strong>Game IDs are in the format of [YYYYMMDD][3 letter abbreviation of the home team] (ex. 202402270BOS for the Celtic's home win over the Sixers a few days ago)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3><strong>Getting Player IDs</strong></h3>
                    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Head's Up: Basketball-Reference will lock you out for an hour if you make more than 20 calls in a minute so keep that in mind.</div>
                    <p>Since there can be duplicates of the first part of the player ID (harrito can be both Tony Harris and Tobias Harris) further confirmation needs to be done to get the proper player ID. An example player page is shown below:</p>
                    <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail" src="assets/bballplayerscreen.png" alt="Player Page">
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>So in order to get the proper player ID we need to:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Convert the player's name to the proper format</li>
                        <li>Iterate through the player pages until we find the correct player by matching the name or until the page 404s indicating we've reached the end of that name</li>
                        <li>Add the name to a list if it matches</li>
                        <li>Return the name(s) (Can be more than one if two players have the exact same name)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The function I've written below does this:</p>
